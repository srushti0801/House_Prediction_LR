# House_Prediction_LR
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices using Linear Regression based on various property features. This can assist real estate stakeholders in making informed decisions.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates house rent prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to assist tenants, landlords, and real estate agencies in making informed decisions by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Sklearn

- **Evaluation** using:
   - R² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
 
# Prediction
- **These help you measure your model’s accuracy**:
    - If SSE, MSE, or RMSE are low, it means your model is predicting house prices well.
    - If they’re high, the model is making bigger mistakes.
